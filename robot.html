            The game this year is centered on this year's game piece: dodgeballs.
            Two teams of two robots compete against each other for as many points as
            possible. These robots are placed on a game field with a hill in the middle
            separating them from interfering with each other. The center of the hill can be
            accessed by both teams and is where the majority of dodgeballs begin the game. Each
            team gains points by putting the dodgeballs into specific areas of the other team's side
            through whatever means necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="text challenges">
            Each team's side has three main structures: a small target,
            a large target, and multiplier pillars. Teams score points with the targets on the opposing team's
            side, with the small targets closer to reach and the large targets further away. 25 points are earned
            for each ball that exits the top layer of the small target, 50 points are earned for each ball that exits
            the bottom layer of the small target, and 250 points are earned for each ball that goes into the large target.
            On top of this, each team has two small and one big pillar on their own side of the game field that multiplies
            their total score. For every extra pillar that a team has a ball on compared to their opponent, they gain an
            additional +0.5x multiplier to their total score. When the 5 total minutes of playtime finish, there are also
            points given depending on where each dodgeball on the other team's side lies.

            As for the launcher, even more ideas were pitched for a short while before being discarded. 
            A catapult system was quickly ruled out due to the amount of time required to reset it to its
            initial position. A blunt force system where the ball was struck hard on a ramp was also ruled
            out due to the large amount of inaccuracy that could ensue. Despite the large number of ideas,
            the idea of two flywheels on opposite ends spinning the ball forward at an angle was decided 
            as the main concept fairly quickly. A working prototype was even created before the winter break,
            showing the feasibility of the concept from a power point of view. During the march break, however,
            it was decided that the flywheel system would expand to three flywheels, each 120 degrees apart. This
            was to allow the top flywheel to attach to the treads system for picking up the balls, and also to launch
            the balls with even more precision and power.

        <p class="text" class="howFixed">
            Since a lot of the main components of the robot were not included in the previous robots
            and therefore not owned by the club, the construction of the robot had to be delayed many 
            times in order to buy unique parts, causing construction to be delayed past the winter break. 
            However, during this time, almost the entirety of the robot was pre-built through designs in CAD. 
            This let the members almost immediately assemble every smaller section of the robot when the necessary 
            parts came in, cutting down on inefficient time experimenting with build layouts. It also pointed out some 
            initial flaws in the design, such as the initial design being wider than allowed, and ruling out some earlier
            launcher and collector ideas due to their incompatibility with each other.
