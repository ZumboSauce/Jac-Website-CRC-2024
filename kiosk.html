            Like all major construction, the kiosk building started with a brainstorming phase. 
            With a theme as expansive as Minecraft is, there were many things that were thought 
            possible to add to the kiosk, while only a few ideas could be chosen to actually be 
            implemented. An overarching theme of the kiosk being a house made of wooden planks was
            quickly decided upon, with walls chosen to be built on three sides excluding the front 
            almost immediately. It was also decided that a crafting table would be built in the middle
            of the kiosk for the robot team to use for repairs and storage.

            When the winter break began and the team received access to the Agora, 
            a large open area in the college, work on the kiosk began. The key focus
            of the work during the winter break was on building and starting the painting
            of all of the surrounding walls, as the walls that make up the kiosk are the most
            essential element of it. Due to the fact that many members were either on vacation
            or could not come to the college on a daily basis, construction went a little 
            slower than anticipated, as while every wall was able to be constructed 
            individually, only the background layer of paint was able to be applied.
            This problem was somewhat helped with the use of free food as an incentive 
            for members to show up more often, leading to many more people appearing near
            the end of the break, and progress speeding up, especially with the stencil
            and beginning of painting the individual pixels of the wall.

            From the beginning of the winter semester to the end of March break,
            most of the work done on the kiosk continued to be the painting of 
            the walls. Many members once again were unable to come frequently on 
            March break, leading to progress slowing more than anticipated, especially
            with many kiosk members leaving to help film and act in the produced video for
            a couple days. However, regardless of the adversity, the vast majority of the wall
            painting was finished by the end of March break, and the construction of the crafting
            table had already begun.
