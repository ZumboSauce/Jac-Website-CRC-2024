GENERAL:
TThis year's competition, named Kryptic 2024, will take place at Cur√©-Antoine-Labelle high school from
April 11-13th.
ROBOT:
The game this year is centred on this year's game piece: dodgeballs. Two teams of two robots compete
against each other for as many points as possible. These robots are placed on a game field with a hill
in the middle separating them from interfering with each other. The center of the hill can be accessed
by both teams and is where the majority of dodgeballs begin the game. Each team gains points by putting
the dodgeballs into specific areas of the other team's side through whatever means necessary. Each
team's side has three main structures: a small target, a large target, and multiplier pillars. Teams
score points with the targets on the opposing team's side, with the small targets closer to reach and
the large targets further away. 25 points are earned for each ball that exits the top layer of the 
small target, 50 points are earned for each ball that exits the bottom layer of the small target, and
250 points are earned for each ball that goes into the large target. On top of this, each team has two
small and one big pillar on their own side of the game field that multiplies their total score. For
each tower more a team has a ball on compared to their opponent, they gain an additional +0.5x multiplier
to their total score. When the 5 total minutes of playtime finish, there is also points given for where
each dodgeball on the other team's side lies.
