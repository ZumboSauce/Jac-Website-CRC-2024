                    As a part of the competition, a video must be made that showcases both the rules of the game and the team’s main theme. Work began during the winter break, when the team decided on the main plot elements of the video, along with the planning of certain scenes and the elements in Minecraft. The main theme of the video was decided to be a cult of sphere enthusiasts, as the competition uses sphere dodgeballs while Minecraft features no curved geometry. About a week before March Break, the entire script and screenplay were finished by Aden. This is when it was decided to film the majority of the scenes in the clubroom and the  Anne-Marie Edward (AME) building staircases, as they were two areas that we knew we would be able to have access to.

                    Filming was all completed during the March break. Over three days, each scene was filmed a few times so each scene would have at least one good take for use in the final product. Every actor and director is a member of the robotics team, removing any issues of missing pivotal actors for scenes. The scenes that caused the largest issues were those with many lines uninterrupted, as each actor did not have very long to memorize their lines. There were also some issues with syncing the camera angle on the stairs of AME with that filmed in Minecraft.

                    After the filming was completed, editing started almost immediately, led by Zoé. This was the longest part of the process, as the sheer amount of takes and scenes filmed led to the process of even reducing the amount of takes to only one per scene taking a long time. There were no major issues requiring retakes, but a lot of sound engineering was needed for audio balancing, and the addition of background music added time to the process as well. The largest issue was that the initial final cut produced was longer than the allocated length, requiring some extra scenes to be cut out of the video. While this did not affect the plot of the video, it was difficult to remove content while keeping the viewing experience fluid.

                    At the top of the page is the video we created. The video follows Steve and Alex dying in Minecraft and discovering a cult of sphere enthusiasts planning to take over the world during                  Kryptic 2024. To find out the rest, you’ll have to watch :)
