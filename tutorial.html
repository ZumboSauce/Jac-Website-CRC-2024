                Along with a video on the rules of the competition, a shorter video tutorial teaching the viewer how to accomplish one of the key tasks associated with the competition must be created. Since the team had made a tutorial on the robot aspect last year, this year we decided to make a video about the kiosk section of the competition. While ideas such as how to construct stable kiosk walls were thrown around, a central idea of painting murals was decided on due to the amount of painting involved in our kiosk this year. The main ideas to be talked about were decided upon during the March break, and the final locations and overall script were finalized by its end.

                All filming was completed just after March break since only a few scenes had to be filmed. The filming was done during regular kiosk construction design, so most of the work being done in the video was the actual kiosk progress at that time. There werenâ€™t many challenges during the filming, other than some difficulties finding a large projector for a scene.

                Editing began immediately after the completion of the filming. While there were fewer scenes than the video, the audio between each take was sometimes drastically different, as almost every scene was in a different location. This led to editing taking a fairly long time, mainly being the audio and subtitles added on.
